The company will then expand deliveries to other cities and hospitals across the UK who will face a difficult winter due to the ongoing impact of Covid-19.</p> <p>Deliveroo has been working with restaurant partners to secure donations of meals. Although the restaurant sector is facing a very tough time, a number of our restaurant partners are supporting with donations. This includes Pizza Hut, who will include not just pizza but side salads, pasta and other options and Rosa's Thai Cafe, who will be donating 500 meals per week. The company will also be working with local independent restaurants near the hospitals it is delivering to. </p> <p>The delivery company raised almost £2m from consumer and corporate donations and delivered 750,000 meals to NHS workers earlier this year, delivering to NHS workers' homes through vouchers and directly to hospitals. This latest commitment means Deliveroo and partners will deliver over 1m meals to NHS staff working on the Covid-19 frontlines this year.</p> <p>This commitment from Deliveroo and partners will last as long as there is a need from NHS workers.</p> <p>Half a million pounds is also being given in donations to NHS Trusts across the country. The donation was raised by generous consumers and partners as part of Deliveroo's fundraising NHS campaign. Deliveroo will continue to fundraise to support the campaign over the winter period, with customers able to donate through the app. </p> <p>Deliveroo is also working with partners to deliver to vulnerable families this Christmas. The company is working with Pret A Manger and Co-Op to deliver food to Felix Project and FareShare, who will distribute the food to food banks and community groups.</p> <p>Secretary of State of Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock said: "As we go into this new period of tighter restrictions, our incredible NHS staff need all of our support. I know just how much the public support meant to our workforce in the first peak, so I am very pleased that Deliveroo will once again be providing free food to our incredible workforce working on the frontline to keep us safe. I want to say thank you Deliveroo and thanks to all Deliveroo's customers for supporting our NHS."</p> <p>Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo, said: "People always rely on the NHS in winter, and this year perhaps more than ever. NHS workers will play an invaluable role in keeping us and our loved ones safe. That's why we are relaunching our campaign to deliver free meals to healthcare workers and vulnerable people. We want to make this small gesture of our enormous gratitude for all those working in healthcare. As a British business we feel duty-bound to use our network and partners to support the NHS and vulnerable groups who will be impacted by this crisis."</p> <p>Neil Manhas, General Manager of Pizza Hut UK, said: "At a time when Britain needs a boost and NHS workers need the nation's support we're delighted that both our company owned stores and several of our franchise partners are once again partnering with Deliveroo to give  pizza and other dishes to our incredible NHS heroes. We're incredibly grateful for their hard work and dedication over this challenging period, and hopefully this small token of our appreciation, brings some smiles to the hardworking frontline during this tough time." </p> <p>Samuel Hay, Doctor, North Manchester General Hospital, said: "It's amazing the power of a slice of pizza when things are hard, Deliveroo have dropped off donations for us in April through to June and are starting again. We really appreciate all the donations and support, it's a really tough time and we're very busy but finding time to have a slice or some hot food can really turn the day around.</p> <p>Thank you from the staff at North Manchester General Hospital."</p> <p>Ends</p> <p>About Deliveroo</p> <p>Deliveroo is an award-winning delivery service founded in 2013 by William Shu and Greg Orlowski.
